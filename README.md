Update your project so that the introduction section is written. The section will likely contain 2 - 3 paragraphs and will cover the following topics:

- overview of what you are studying and why it is important,
- discussion of the data source, and
- clear specification of your research question.

Also include the second part of the the paper - sample size calculation. This should contain a mix of equations and prose. If you are working in a situation where we have not explicitly talked about sample size calculations, feel free to make any simplifying assumptions and use the SRS framework.
